#+title: Project Notes

* Notes

- To find central surface brightness, \( I_{0} = 10^{(m_{0} - b)/2.5} \)
- To find disk scale length, \( h_{R} = \dfrac{2.5}{m \ln 10} \)
- \( I(R) = I_{0} \exp\left[ -\dfrac{R}{h_{R}} \right] \)
- \( I' = -2.5 \log_{10} I + m_{0} \)

* Questions

- What should the output be?
  - Slope (convert to disk scale length) and intercept
- What are reasonable parameter ranges for profile generation? Half light radius? SÃ©rsic index? Find others in =profile.py=
  - Read code comments

* To do

- Apply changes to random generation 
- Better threshold location using bulge + disk and piecewise models from legacy
